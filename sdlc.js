// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfReq = "This is the seconed step, in which developers will breakdown what is required to acheive the desired outcome."
const design = "This is the third step, Developers will begin to write pseudocode or a rough draft based on what they have deemed neccassary in steps one and two."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, developers will begin to write functional code using the outline from step three. "
const testingInt = "This is the fifth step, in which developers will take their code and test it in everyway to find bugs or problems with it."
const maintain = " This is the the final step, it involves updating and supporting the software after it has been deemed useable and implemented"
